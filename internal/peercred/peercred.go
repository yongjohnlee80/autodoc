// Package peercred keeps the daemon's unix socket between processes of one user. The socket is
// the daemon's only access control: no login, no token. Whoever connects can call every verb,
// file.write anywhere on the user's disk among them. So both ends check who is at the other end:
//
//   - the daemon drops a connection whose peer runs as another user (Listener), and a client
//     refuses a daemon that runs as another user (Dial), from the kernel's own record of the peer
//     (SO_PEERCRED on Linux, LOCAL_PEERCRED on macOS), not from a file mode that a umask, a chmod
//     race or a wider directory can open;
//   - the daemon binds only in a directory no other user can write (CheckDir), where nobody can
//     replace its socket, or put their own at its path first, for a client to dial.
//
// The default socket ($XDG_RUNTIME_DIR, or the 0700 state directory) passes every check; they bite
// on a server.socket configured into a shared directory such as /tmp.
//
// Concurrency: every function is safe for concurrent use; a Listener is as safe as the listener it
// wraps.

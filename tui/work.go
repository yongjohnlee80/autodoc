// Nothing that talks to the daemon runs on the UI loop. do runs fn on its own goroutine under the
// host's context and applies its result on the loop with then. The result says which generation it
// was issued under; then decides whether it still applies. A late answer to a question nobody is
// asking any more is dropped there, never here.
